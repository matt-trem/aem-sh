# aem.sh

Single-file shell script for local AEM development on latest macOS (M1). No other platform is tested, but feel free to extend and open a PR. The script:

* uses the `~/aem-sdk` directory,
* uses default ports `4502`, `4503`,
* sets corresponding JVM debugger ports at `45020`, `45030`,
* doubles the memory allocation,
* and adds a `local` runmode.


## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependency requirements are met.

* Java JDK 11:
```
~ % java -version
java version "11.0.16" 2022-07-19 LTS

Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.16+11-LTS-199, mixed mode)
```

* [AEM as a Cloud Service SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developing/aem-as-a-cloud-service-sdk.html?lang=en)
* `brew install jq`
* The GNU versions of `sed` and `grep` - see [this](https://medium.com/@bramblexu/install-gnu-sed-on-mac-os-and-set-it-as-default-7c17ef1b8f64) - and confirm with:

```
~ % sed --version
sed (GNU sed) 4.8

~ % grep --version
grep (GNU grep) 3.7
```

* Set the `AEM_PROJECT_HOME` environment


## Get started

1. Clone this repo
1. Create the `aem` symlink on your `$PATH`. A possible approach:
  * Create `~/bin` and in your profile: `export $PATH=$PATH:~/bin`
  * Create the symlink: `ln -s ~/path/to/your/clone/aem-sh/aem.sh ~/bin/aem`
1 Test with `aem help` to see the script's usage.
1. Create `~/aem-sdk`
1. Download the AEM SDK zip and unzip to `/aem-sdk/sdk`
1. Download your content packages from the source Author (typically Production), and please under `~/aem-sdk/packages` and is used by `aem install_content`
1. Optional: build your AEM project - the `all` artifact (zip file) is used by `aem install_code`



## Commands

### Create an empty AEM instance

`aem create author` and `aem create publish` to create a local Author and Publish, respectively

### Get the status

`aem status` will print the status of both instances

### Stop the instance

`aem stop author` will gracefully stop and shutdown the specified instance.


### Start the instance

`aem start author` will the specified AEM instance, and wait until all the bundles are active.

### Log the instance

`aem log publish` will tail the `error.log` file of the `publish` instance.

You can specify an additional argument for another log file. For example, if you configured a `my-service.log` log file, run `aem log publish my-service`.


### Destroy instances

`aem destroy author` will prompt you for a confirmation, then forcefully stop the specified instance if running, and delete its home directory.


### Install content

`aem install_content author` uploads and installs all the content packages stored under `~/aem-sdk/packages` to the specified instance.

DAM workflows are disabled before installing, and re-enabled post-install, to prevent ootb, expensive asset workflows from triggering.


### Install code

`aem install_code publish` will look for the `all` build artifact under `$AEM_PROJECT_HOME/all/target` (this assumes the project was built) and upload and install it to the specified instance.


### Run the Dispatcher web server

`aem dispatcher` will start the Dispatcher using the configs and rules under `$AEM_PROJECT_HOME/dispatcher/src`.

Then you can browse the site at `http://localhost:8080/`.

* Make sure Docker Desktop is running
* Make sure the AEM Publisher is running


### Notes

* For commands `start` `stop`, `status`, if you omit the instance type, i.e. `aem start`, the script will run the command for both instance types.
