# aem.sh

Single-file shell script for local AEM development on Apple M1. No other platform is tested.

The script:

* uses the `~/aem-sdk` directory,
* uses default ports `4502`, `4503`,
* sets corresponding JVM debugger ports at `45020`, `45030`,
* doubles the memory allocation,
* adds a `local` runmode
* and has a bunch of pretty colors!


## Dependencies

The script does not manage dependencies. They are:

* Java JDK 11:
```
~ % java -version
java version "11.0.16" 2022-07-19 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.16+11-LTS-199)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.16+11-LTS-199, mixed mode)
```
* [AEM as a Cloud Service SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developing/aem-as-a-cloud-service-sdk.html?lang=en) - place the unzipped folder under `~/aem-sdk`
* `jq`
* `lsof`
* GNU versions of `sed` and `grep` - very important! Read how to install these with `brew` and set your `PATH` so that the brew executables are picked up first. To confirm:
```
~ % sed --version
sed (GNU sed) 4.8

~ % grep --version
grep (GNU grep) 3.7
```

Generally a good idea to stick to GNU and not the BSD versions of these utilities.


## Get started

* Clone this
* Create `~/bin` and in your profile `export $PATH=$PATH:~/bin`
* Create the symlink to `aem.sh`: `~/bin % ln -s ~/path/to/your/clone/aem-sh/aem.sh`
* Test with `aem help`

## Examples

### Create a local Author instance

```
aem create author
```

This is

```
aem create publish
```

After these finish, check the status of the instances:


```
aem status
```

### Stop the instance

```
aem stop author
```

If you omit the instance type i.e. `aem stop`, the script attempts to process both types.

### Start the instance

```
aem start
```

will start both instances.

### Log the instance

```
aem log author
```

will tail the `error.log` file of the `author` instance. You can specify another parameter for another log file. For example, if you configured a `my-service.log` log file, `aem log author my-service`


### Destroy instances

```
aem destroy author
```

will prompt you for a confirmation, then stop the instance if it is running, then delete the folder.

### Restore content

Rather than committing paths and filenames to source, the script uses environment variables. Set them in your

```
# aem.sh
export AEM_PACKAGE_ASSETS=~/aem-sdk/content-collibra-assets.zip
export AEM_PACKAGE_ASSETS=~/aem-sdk/content-collibra.zip
```

Then run

```
aem restore_content author
```

on a fresh AEM instance, and the content is restored. DAM Workflows are disabled before installing, and re-enabled post-install.
